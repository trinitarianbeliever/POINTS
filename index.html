                If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
                But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
                For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
                A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
